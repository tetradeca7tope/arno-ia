The complete galaxy properties of MassiveBlack II simulation

For each posted redshift it is a complete rip-off of the simulation
data.

We have position velocity id of every particle that is in a group;
and also the often used properties of groups, plus predicted band luminosity
for various filter sets.

Binary files are in intel endian.

Recommend to use mmap to access some of the huge files;
for example, the star properties at 085 are ~10 GB in size.

readsubhalo.py implements SnapDir objects which can be used to access
the data in python. 

Cosmology:

n_s=0.968
sigma_8=0.816
Omega_Lambda = 0.725
Omega_m= 0.275
Omega_baryon = 0.046
h=0.701

Data model: 
----------------
           id
particles  0 1   2 3 4    5 6 7 8 9 10 11     12 13 14 ....
subhalo    |0--| |1----|  |2-contamination|   |3-----|  ....
group      [0-----------------------------]   [1------------

Particles are first cut into groups.
Within groups, gravitationally bound objects are subhalos. 
unbound particles are contaminations.

directory structure:
--------------------

The isolated subhalos are stored in 
  {snapshotid}/

Each archive has the following files/dirs:

meta data:

    /header.txt

    the value of flag_double(header) is important. It decides the precision of
    the particle properties
    
    the value of redshift(header) is also handy. 

group tab:
    grouphalotab.raw is a C struct array of the following type:

    use SnapDir.readgroup() to read in the tab.

    groupdtype = numpy.dtype([
        ('mass', 'f4'), 
        ('len', 'i4'), 
        ('pos', ('f4', 3)), 
        ('vel', ('f4', 3)), 
        ('nhalo', 'i4'),   
        ('massbytype', ('f4', 6)),  
        ('lenbytype', ('u4',6)), 
       ])

    One group per entry, ordered by number of particles

subhalo tab:
    subhalotab.raw is a C struct of the following type:

    one subhalo per entry, plus one entry for the contamination
    For example, if the first group has nhalo = 100, then there will
    be 101 subhalo entries. 

    This is indicated in subhalo/type.raw (u1). If the type is 0
    then entry is a subhalo. if the type is 1, the entry is a contamination.

        load('subhalo', 'type') reads in the types.

    ** Be aware of the contaminations for subhalo analysis **

        load('subhalo', 'tab') reads in the tab.

    subdtype = numpy.dtype([
        ('mass', 'f4'),  # mass, nan for contamination
        ('len', 'i4'), 
        ('pos', ('f4', 3)), 
        ('vel', ('f4', 3)),   
        ('vdisp', 'f4'),  
        ('vcirc', 'f4'),  
        ('rcirc', 'f4'),  
        ('parent', 'i4'),  
        ('massbytype', ('f4', 6)),  
        ('lenbytype', ('u4',6)), 
        ('unused', 'f4'),    
        ('groupid', 'u4'), 
       ])
     
    the luminosity of subhalos at various band are also available (described in
        next section).

    For easying the access, we have performed some joint queries and provide
    the following extra properties of subhalos:

     ( use with SnapDir.load('subhalo', propertyname) )

    subhalo/type.raw  : int8 array of type of the entry: 
                        0 for subhalo 
                        1 for contamination
    subhalo/sfr.raw  : float32 array of total star formation of each entry
    subhalo/bhmass.raw : float32 array of total bhmass of each entry
    subhalo/bhmdot.raw : float32 array of total bhmdot of each entry
    subhalo/bhmassive.raw : property of most massive bh of each entry
    subhalo/bhluminous.raw : property of most luminous bh of each entry

    the type of entries in bhmassive and bhluminous are:
        bhdtype = numpy.dtype([
            ('pos', ('f4', 3)),
            ('vel', ('f4', 3)),
            ('id', 'u8'),
            ('bhmass', 'f8'),
            ('bhmdot', 'f8')])
        bhmass is NaN if there is no bh in that subhalo or contamination.
    
Particle properties:
    /{particletype}/{blockname}.raw
    
    use SnapDir.load(particletype, blockname)
       [optionally give g=subhalotab or g=grouptab to access groups/subhalos], see doc.

    Particle types are 
       0: Gas
       1: Dark mater    
       2&3: unused
       4: Star
       5: BH

    The following blocks have fixed data type:
        ('pos', ('f4', 3)),
        ('vel', ('f4', 3)),
        ('mass', 'f4'),
        ('id', 'u8'),
        ('type', 'u1')

    The other blocks, currently including 
        0/sfr.raw 
        4/met.raw 
        5/bhmass.raw
        5/bhmdot.raw

    are floating numbers, width of witch decided by 
    the value of flag_double in header.txt.
    (simply match the flag_double line)
    float64 : if flag_double is 1
    float32 : if flag_double is 0

    One particle per entry in any of the blocks.
    The particles are ordered in chunks; one chunk per subhalo/contamination.
    Look at the lenbytype value in subhalo tab or group tab.

    For example, 
    if the first group has lenbytype == [50000, 100000, 0, 0, 50000, 100],
    and the second group has lenbytype == [10000, 20000, 0, 0, 10000, 10],

    0:50000 in 0/*.raw are gas in the first group,
    0:100000 in 1/*.raw are dark matter in the first group,
    0:50000 in 4/*.raw are star in the first group,
    0:100 in 5/*.raw are black hole in the first group.

    50000:60000 in 0/*.raw are gas in the second group,
    100000:12000 in 1/*.raw are dark matter in the second group,
    50000:60000 entries in 4/*.raw are star in the second group,
    100:110 entries in 5/*.raw are black hole in the second group.

Subhalo spectra SED and band luminosity :

    The full SED spectra of subhalos is mocked according to Wilkins et al. 2013.
    use SnapDir.readSED to read the SED for a given subhalo. Note that
    if the subhalo has no stars there is no SED and the function returns 0
    the returned SED has nebula lines.

    We also have the band luminosity of the subhalos, integrated from the SED.

    For subhalos with no stars, and for the subhalo entry corresponding to
    contamination, all bands are zero.

    Files are named by for example sbuhaloHST.ACS.raw.
    Refer to readsubhalo.py and bandfilterdtype for all the available bands.

    Two categories of filters `RfFilter' for restframe, and 
    `ObsFilter' for observed frame.

    Subhalos:
    --------
    The band luminosity can be loaded like other 'subhalo' variables, eg, 

        SnapDir.load('subhalo', 'RfFilter/SDSS.SDSS/i')

        (saved  under RfFilter/SDSS.SDSS/i , in 'f4')

        They are in f4 of and of unit 1e28 Erg/s/Hz.

    Star particles:
    ----
    The band luminosity of individual star particles can be loaded via

        (eg)
        SnapDir.loadstarLband('RfFilter', 'SDSS.SDSS/r')
    
    IGM absoprtion and nebula lines are included.

    The bands are saved in a compressed format:
     1. The filtered band luminosity per unit mass of 260 time/metallicity 
        bins are calculated and saved in SED/SEDtableXXXX.
     2. 4/SEDindex.raw saves the index of the table entry that saves the
        band luminosity per unit mass.   (Erg/s/Hz/[1e10Msun/h])
     3. Multiply the entry by the mass of the star particle
        gives its true band luminosity.

     See Snapdir.loadstarLband for more details.
